    title: 'The Formation of Coral Reefs',
    body: `Coral reefs, often called the rainforests of the sea, are marine ecosystems that support a rich diversity of life. They form over thousands of years as coral polyps—tiny, soft-bodied organisms—secrete calcium carbonate to create a hard skeleton. The Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Australia, is the largest coral reef system in the world, stretching over 2,300 kilometers. These incredible underwater landscapes provide habitat for numerous species and contribute to the health of the oceans.`
